# Breast Cancer Prediction

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in effective treatment and patient outcomes. This project leverages **machine learning**, specifically **XGBoost**, to classify whether a patient has breast cancer based on diagnostic attributes. It also incorporates **K-Fold Cross Validation** to ensure robustness and reliability in predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information
- **Filename:** `breast_cancer.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset consists of patient medical records with multiple diagnostic attributes used for classification.
- **Target Variable:** Binary classification indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer.
- **Preprocessing Steps:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
```

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JPS9380/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction
```
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb
```
Execute the notebook cells step by step to train and evaluate the model.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Insights
- The XGBoost model delivers **high accuracy** in classifying breast cancer cases.
- The use of **K-Fold Cross Validation** ensures the model's robustness.
